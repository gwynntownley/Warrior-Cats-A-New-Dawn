WARRIOR CATS : A NEW DAWN (or 'WCND')

I. INFORMATION REGARDING PRODUCT

A. VERSION

The first stable release of WCND was the beta 0.1, released
as a private developmental build in March 2020.
The version of WCND contained in this folder is beta 0.6.5
This means it is an experimental pre-release build intended
only for developers on the project.

B. NAMING

The working title for this project is Warrior Cats : A New
Dawn, often abbreviated as WCND or WCaND. It should be 
stressed that the developer does not consider this to be
a representative or permanent title. The name was chosen
specifically because of its broad appeal and common
usage as a title, which works while the project is
under development but will most likely be replaced with
a name more relevant to the core mechanics and world
contained within the project.

That said, as of this build, referring to the game under
the titles Warrior Cats : A New Dawn, A New Dawn, WCND,
or WCaND is perfectly acceptable, even though the name
is solely temporary.

C. OWNERSHIP

This is a fan-project of an established creative work,
meaning none of the ideas contained within can be solely
credited to the project developer, ANNWYN MEDIA (nee FUNNYBUG STUDIOS). All
of the setting, world, and core story elements, even if
not borrowed exactly from the adapted work (WARRIOR CATS),
then, must be credited to HARPER COLLINS PUBLISHING, the
ERIN HUNTER TEAM, and the WORKING PARTNERS TEAM. 

Fanworks are not usually protected under copyright law
as, in most cases, they do not qualify for the
transformative Fair Use clause. However, this does not
automatically make WCND unlawful, only that should
the owners of the adapted creative property (WARRIOR CATS)
pursue a takedown, the project developer will be
obligated to take the project down.

However, while all ideas can be attributed to the owners
of WARRIOR CATS, whose names are given above, the scripts
and design involved in WCND's gameplay and U.I. are
property of the developer, ANNWYN MEDIA (nee FUNNYBUG STUDIOS).

Speaking as developer, on the subject of modification to
the project's source, be it script or UI, we take no issue
in the practice. Fanworks or modifications of the project,
so long as some form of credit is attributed, is
wholeheartedly appreciated.

D. LEGAL BOUNDS

The developer of WCND is based in California, United States,
and any and all claims regarding ownership and copyright
fall under California jurisdiction. 

E. CONTACT
